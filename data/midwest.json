Springfield is at No. 13; Kansas City is No. 6 and St. Louis is No. 2. Repeating the phrase \"tough on crime\" is great for campaigning, but it does little actually to reduce violent crime and victimization.  Because local governments have come to rely too much on the collection of fines and fees, they have turned law enforcement into modern-day tax collectors. At the state level, the prison budget has increased more than $150 million dollars in just a decade (making Missouri 8th highest in its rate of incarceration). But violent crime has not gone down, but up. That’s because half the state’s prison population is incarcerated for a non-violent offense, at a cost of more than $350 million. In sum, Missouri is spending way too many resources on people it can suck revenue out of, and not nearly enough on effective strategies to reduce violent crime.

This can result in misplaced focus on issues and concerns of interest to narrow constituencies within the base of their party, and too little focus on the basic challenges facing Missouri families.\n\nA continuous focus on divisive social causes makes problem solving related to performing the basic functions of Missouri state government harder. Endless pursuit of  tax cuts to appeal to donors and party elites, while leaving our school and universities underfunded and the problem of deteriorating road and bridges unaddressed, leaves Missouri families frustrated with their state government and with the entire political process.\n\nHistorically, state governments have been able to continue to function and tackle the basic functions of government while national disfunction raged. The single biggest challenge leaders must confront to secure a better future for Missouri may very well be avoiding the agendas of narrow special interests and remembering that their actual goal should be securing a better future for all Missourians."},{"first":"Patrick","last":"Tuohey","title":"Director of municipal policy, The Show-Me Institute","answer":"Missouri’s taxes are too numerous, too high and too unfair. That is not to say that all taxes are bad or that some shouldn’t be higher. But taxes, even in the best cases, distort the free market, increase costs and create unintended consequences. Taxes should be — for everyone — low and few in number. Missouri has almost 1,400 different sales tax jurisdictions, including the state, cities, counties and all the various \"alphabet districts\" such as CIDs and TDDs. The result is that sales taxes sometimes exceed 12 percent. The Show-Me State and its cities even tax food. To make matters worse, Kansas City and St. Louis levy a flat 1 percent income tax on earnings alone that includes no exemption on low-income workers. Nothing is more regressive than taxing food and income without exemption. And what do we do with the money? Too often, city and state leaders hand it off to wealthy and well-connected developers in the form of credits and subsidies — diverting money away from much-needed basic services such as infrastructure and education. If Missouri does not work to reduce the number and rates of taxes, we risk continuing our anemic economic and population growth."},{"first":"Scott","last":"Wagner","title":"Kansas City Mayor Pro Tem","answer":"Our single biggest challenge is preparing the workforce for tomorrow to leave no one behind. The jobs of the future depend on skill sets that require both soft and technical skills that are challenging for many Missourians. It goes beyond traditional education. It means workforce development that prepares a new generation, or transitioning the present workforce to construction, software development and many other vocations that require the skills that will give people their best chance at a career. Economic growth that leads to neighborhood stabilization comes from talent, and we need to grow that."},{"first":"Maurice A.","last":"Watson","title":"Partner, Husch Blackwell LLP","answer":"Development, recruitment and retention of talent needed to provide strong, creative and innovative leadership in the future in government, business, education and the nonprofit sectors.  Without such talent, the state will fall behind and fail to thrive."},{"first":"Pam ","last":"Whiting","title":"Vice president/communications, Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce","answer":"My answer, in one word:  education.  \nSupport for both K-12 and higher education is critical, but I’d like to focus on the very youngest Missourians. \nAs sister to the head of a Montessori school, I’ve learned a lot about early childhood education.  Did you know, for example, that 90 percent of a child’s brain architecture is developed by the time that child is five?  \nGetting children off to the right start pays off, reducing juvenile delinquency, addictions, school dropout rates, learning disabilities, obesity, and other problems.  Estimates are for every dollar invested in early childhood education, society sees a return on investment of $12.  \nYet one in three kids in Kansas City Public Schools doesn’t have the skills they need to succeed when they enter kindergarten. They’re behind even before they start.   \nThat needs to change, which is why I’m proud that my organization, the KC Chamber, has launched Pre-KC,  an initiative to increase awareness of the importance of quality early childhood education.
