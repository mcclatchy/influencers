[{"first":"Mel ","last":"Martinez","title":"Chairman, Southeast U.S. and Latin America, JP Morgan Chase","answer":"Florida continues to be a destination for people seeking a life full of opportunity. We have one of the highest population rates in the nation and millions of new residents are moving here in search of economic opportunities. Unfortunately, economic prosperity is hard to reach for many. In recent years, following the economic downturn and Hurricanes Irma and Maria, we have seen an alarming increase in people experiencing homelessness due to the lack of affordable housing. We have one of the nation’s highest rates of cost-burdened renters and the greatest shortage of affordable housing. As a result, thousands of Floridians end up living in hotels or motels, doubling up with other families, in homeless shelters, or on the streets. This is unacceptable. We must shine a light on this issue and work collectively to develop solutions that will make Florida a destination where everyone has a place to call home."},{"first":"Stephen","last":"Zack","title":"Partner, Boies Schiller & Flexner","answer":""},{"first":"Fabiola","last":"Fleuranvil","title":"CEO, Blueprint Creative Group","answer":""},{"first":"Mike","last":"Fernandez","title":"Chairman, MBF Healthcare Partners","answer":"Recently, business and community leaders from every political stripe came together to successfully defeat two anti-immigrant, anti-jobs measures. They modeled pragmatic leadership to advance Florida’s economy and immigrant families. This group contributed over $86B to Florida’s coffers. Immigrants are 25 percent of Florida's workforce and employ over 500,000 fellow Floridians. Like my parents, they have a warm heart and a willingness to work. On immigration, Florida can model bipartisan and solution-oriented leadership for the nation. The Sunshine State shows that diversity makes our state and our economy strong, and that anti-immigrant efforts in any form are a threat to Florida’s reputation, our public safety, our ability to welcome tourists and recruit new workers, and ultimately, our economy.\n"},{"first":"Thomas","last":"Wenski","title":"Archbishop of Miami","answer":""},{"first":"Jacob","last":"Solomon","title":"President and CEO, Greater Miami Jewish Federation","answer":""},{"first":"Michael","last":"Finney","title":"President and CEO, Miami-Dade Beacon Council","answer":""},{"first":"Brian","last":"Keeley","title":"President and CEO, Baptist Health South Florida","answer":""},{"first":"William","last":"Talbert, III","title":"President and CEO, Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau","answer":""},{"first":"Eduardo","last":"Padron","title":"President, Miami Dade College","answer":""},{"first":"Maria","last":"Alonso","title":"President and CEO, United Way of Miami-Dade","answer":""},{"first":"Jorge","last":"Perez","title":"Chairman and CEO, Related Group","answer":""},{"first":"Mary Ann","last":"Franks","title":"Professor of Law, University of Miami","answer":""},{"first":"Ralph","last":"Patino","title":"Founder, Patino & Associates","answer":""},{"first":"Jaret","last":"Davis","title":"Co-Managing Shareholder, Greenberg Traurig Miami Office","answer":""},{"first":"Carlos","last":"Garcia Perez","title":"Partner,  SMGQ Law","answer":""},{"first":"Franklin","last":"Sirmans","title":"Director, Perez Art Museum Miami","answer":""},{"first":"Felice ","last":"Gorordo","title":"Global Director, Startup Health","answer":""},{"first":"Al ","last":"Cardenas","title":"Senior Partner, Squire Patton Boggs","answer":""},{"first":"Dimitri","last":"Hoth","title":"Student, Activist, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School","answer":""},{"first":"Emilio","last":"Estefan","title":"CEO, Estefan Enterprises","answer":""},{"first":"Chris","last":"Caines","title":"Executive Director, Miami Urban Future Inititiative, FIU","answer":""},{"first":"Julie","last":"Wraithmell","title":"Executive Director,  Audubon Florida","answer":""},{"first":"Tiffany","last":"Troxler","title":"Director, Sea Level Solutions Center, FIU","answer":""},{"first":"Jeff ","last":"Johnson","title":"State Director, AARP","answer":""},{"first":"Rebecca","last":"O'Hara","title":"Senior Legislative Advocate, Florida League of Cities","answer":""},{"first":"David ","last":"Mica","title":"Executive Director, Florida Petroleum Council","answer":""},{"first":"Susan","last":"Towler","title":"Executive Director, Corporate Social Responsibility, Florida Blue","answer":""},{"first":"Ken ","last":"Lawson","title":"President and CEO, Visit Florida","answer":""},{"first":"Rhea","last":"Law ","title":"Chair, Florida Offices, Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney","answer":""},{"first":"Michael ","last":"Putney","title":"Senior Political Reporter, WPLG","answer":""},{"first":"Shelley","last":"Katz","title":"Vice President Operations, Lutheran Services Florida Health Systems","answer":""},{"first":"Wendy","last":"Spencer","title":"CEO, Leadership Florida","answer":""},{"first":"Margaret ","last":"Lezcano","title":"Managing Director, UBS","answer":""},{"first":"Carol","last":"Probstfeld","title":"President, State College of Florida, Manatee-Sarasota","answer":""},{"first":"Daryl","last":"Tol","title":"CEO, Florida Hospital","answer":""},{"first":"Terry","last":"DeCarlo","title":"Development and Chief Communications Director, The Center of Central Florida","answer":""},{"first":"Marlon","last":"Hill","title":"Partner, Hamilton MIller & Birthisel","answer":""},{"first":"Jessica ","last":"Goldman","title":"CEO, Goldman Properties","answer":""},{"first":"Marleine","last":"Bastein","title":"Executive Director, Haitian Women of Miami","answer":""},{"first":"Richard","last":"Fain","title":"Chairman and CEO, Royal Caribbean Cruisis Ltd.","answer":""},{"first":"Carol","last":"Dover","title":"President, Florida Restaurant & Lodging Association","answer":""},{"first":"Joanne","last":"McCall","title":"President, Florida Education Association","answer":""},{"first":"Victoria","last":"Kasdan","title":"Executive Director, We Care Manatee","answer":""},{"first":"Cindy","last":"Arenberg Seltzer","title":"President and CEO, Children's Services Council of Broward County","answer":""}]
